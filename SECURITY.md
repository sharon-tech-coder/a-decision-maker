# Security Documentation

## Security Guidelines for This Project

This document outlines the security practices followed in this project and provides guidelines for maintaining a secure environment when using third-party libraries.

### 1. **Managing Dependencies**

This project uses several third-party libraries, as described in the `LICENSE.md` document. To ensure the security of our project:
- We regularly update our dependencies to the latest stable versions.
- We monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies using tools.
- We specify exact versions of dependencies in `requirements.txt` and `Pipfile` to avoid accidental use of insecure versions.

### 2. **Auditing Dependencies for Vulnerabilities**

We use automated tools to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies. This includes:
- Running `pip-audit` to detect insecure packages and report vulnerabilities.
- Running `safety` to scan the `requirements.txt` file for known security vulnerabilities.

### 3. **License Compliance and Security**

As part of maintaining a secure project, we also ensure that all third-party libraries comply with their respective licenses. We take the following steps to ensure license compliance:
- We include the copyright and license information in our `LICENSE.md` file for every third-party package used.
- We review and update licenses to ensure no conflicting or incompatible licenses are included in our project.
- For example, the **MIT License** used in the `six==1.17.1` package allows us to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, but we still ensure proper attribution is provided in our project documentation.
